      <description>BioDivPoweR: an R package for assessing power of biodiversity monitoring sampling schemes. Accurate monitoring of biodiversity is necessary for understanding impacts of global change on ecosystems, but sampling designs across hetrogeneous regions can limit statistical power to reliably detect change. BioDivPoweR is an R package for conducting simulation-based power analyses on biodiversity monitoring sampling schemes to provide bespoke sampling assessments and recommendations on user-provided biodiversity data.
This package integrates the simulation-based power analysis workflow developed by Tekwa et al.</description>

      <description>BioShiftR: An R package to access, manipulate, and organize the BioShifts database. BioShifts is a global database of over 31,000 changes in species’ range positions documented in scientific literature, spanning global geographies and taxonomic groups. The database contains documentations of range changes as listed in source publications, as well as standardized calculated rates of change along latitudinal and elevational gradients, and various supplemental data for hypothesis-testing.
BioShifts is a rich resource for studying the effects of climate change on the biogeography of life on Earth, but accessing and manipulating the large and complex database can be daunting.</description>

      <description>Climate Policy Recommendations for Quebec&amp;rsquo;s Comité Consultatif sur les Changements Climatiques In 2024, I received a grant from the Fonds de recherche du Québec to conduct science to guide policy actions for adapting to climate change. My project was an assessment of projected climate change impacts to Canada&amp;rsquo;s marine resources and marine protected areas, from which I formed four generalized policy recommendations for addressing climate change in Canada&amp;rsquo;s oceans, and developed specific recommendations for every marine protected area and every harvested marine species in Canada.</description>

      <description>Targeting Protected Areas to Meet Conservation Goals Here, I worked with a team from the Canadian Department of Fisheries and Oceans Marine Planning and Conservation Team to develop an interactive tool showing how implementation of proposed protected areas on Canada&amp;rsquo;s East Coast would contribute to over 150 quantitative conservation targets for the region.
I used the protected area network design and conservation priotity spatial layers developed by DFO (see documentation here and here), along with the shiny, leaflet, and reactable R packages, and various javascript tricks to develop the application.</description>

      <description>Volcanoes Shiny App This is a Shiny App I made for an interactive Shiny App training I co-taught for the Computational Biodiversity Science and Services (BIOS2) Program. This app was one tool in the 6-hour training. It is accompanied by available and annotated code, explaining where and how workshop participants can add an element to improve the app.

      <description>Kyoto Cherry Blossom Blooms This plot is one of my contributions to the #30DayChartChallenge Twitter data visualization challenge.
The prompt on this day was global change, so I plotted the timing of cherry blossom blooms in Kyoto City, Japan for over 1000 years. Here, I used the ggforce package to turn individual points into flowers and a trend line into a tree branch.

      <description>Canadian Decapod Distribution Shiny App This interactive species distribution map was my contribution to the Canadian Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO) project, Estimating the interacting effects of groundfish predation and climate change on shellfish spatial distributions, funded by the Aquatic Climate Change Adaptation Services Program (ACCASP). The project involves projecting distributions of two Canadian shellfish fisheries based on scenarios of climate and predator density.
I used the leaflet, raster, and sf packages to create distribution maps, and the shinydashboard and shinyWidgets packages to develop the user interface.</description>

      <description>One Decade of American Workers Wages This plot is one of my contributions to the #TidyTuesday R social project.
Here, I show the changes in wages for American workers by racial and ethnic group, as well as the wage gap between male and female workers. In these plots, I wanted to see if I could replicate the style of one of my biggest data visualization inspirations, The Economist. I used ggplot2 for plots, and cowplot to combine plots with background annotations.</description>

      <description>Generative Art January These visualizations represent my second attempt at generative art, inspired by the #Genuary2021 community on twitter. The prompt on this day was: Do anything with these 5 colors. Here, I made two different styles of visualized random data, with some parameters.
First, a modern-art-inspired piece using some geom_ribbons with random slopes behind two groups of randomly generated data points fitted with geom_bspline_closed functions creating curved objects. All colors are randomly chosen out of 5.</description>

      <description>Generative Art January - Increasing Randomness This plot was my first ever attempt at generative art, inspired by the #Genuary2021 community on twitter. The prompt on this day was: Increase the randomness along the Y-axis.
Basically, this code uses point coordinates spread evenly on a canvas, then expanded into 4 corners that will be the anchor points for geom_bspline_closed functions, which create the &amp;ldquo;circles&amp;rdquo; around each group of points. All groups of anchor points have some degree of randomness incorporated, but this randomness grows as a function of increased position on the Y axis.</description>

      <description>Ratings of Washington Hikes This plot is one of my contributions to the #TidyTuesday R social project. This plot shows the average rating scores of hikes in Washington State from reviews including the 10 most commonly used descriptors of trail views.
First, I used the tidytext package to extract every instance in a Washington Trails online review in which the word &amp;ldquo;view&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;views&amp;rdquo; were mentioned, then categorized the most common adjective describing these views.</description>

      <description>PNWColors My interest in natural science is connected to my long appreciation for beauty in nature, but I find that this appreciation can easily be forgotten for us ecologists who research from mostly inside of doors. To remind myself of this connection and to honor my years in the most beautiful place in the world, I developed this R color palette package based off of the natural beauty of the Pacific Northwest.</description>

These visualizations and results were used for marketing the importance of data nights to build and maintain healthy relationships.
All plots were created in ggplot2 with some utilization of extras like ggtext and gghighlight.</description>

      <description>Policy-Driven Market Fluctuations This is a series of plots I made for a California carbon tax consultancy showing market prices of fossil fuel emissions from specific policy initiatives around the world. The specific events and acronyms denoted in these graphs are somewhat esoteric and were largely chosen by the client, but I focused on using clear annotations, color, and spacing to effectively communicate the client&amp;rsquo;s ideas. All plots were completed using ggplot2 and ggforce.</description>
