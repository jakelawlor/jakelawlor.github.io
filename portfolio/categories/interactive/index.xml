      <description>Climate Policy Recommendations for Quebec&amp;rsquo;s Comité Consultatif sur les Changements Climatiques In 2024, I received a grant from the Fonds de recherche du Québec to conduct science to guide policy actions for adapting to climate change. My project was an assessment of projected climate change impacts to Canada&amp;rsquo;s marine resources and marine protected areas, from which I formed four generalized policy recommendations for addressing climate change in Canada&amp;rsquo;s oceans, and developed specific recommendations for every marine protected area and every harvested marine species in Canada.</description>

      <description>Optimizing the use of eDNA for Marine Protected Area surveying in Canada Canada is investing in a large Marine Protected Area (MPA) network, spanning approximately 805,000 km, to preserve marine biodiversity and promote healthy, functional, and resilient marine ecosystems. However, current biodiversity sampling methods are inadequate to monitor biodiversity within a network of this size.
Project Optimize worked to evaluate and optimize marine monitoring survey designs in order to estimate the benefits of biodiversity certainty against the costs, resulting in key quantitative insights into monitoring biodiversity with eDNA.</description>

      <description>Targeting Protected Areas to Meet Conservation Goals Here, I worked with a team from the Canadian Department of Fisheries and Oceans Marine Planning and Conservation Team to develop an interactive tool showing how implementation of proposed protected areas on Canada&amp;rsquo;s East Coast would contribute to over 150 quantitative conservation targets for the region.
I used the protected area network design and conservation priority spatial layers developed by DFO (see documentation here and here), along with the shiny, leaflet, and reactable R packages, and various javascript tricks to develop the application.</description>

      <description>Predictors of vaccine update in New York State This project is an exploratory data article I completed as part of an internship with a Montreal public health analytics company. Here, we use demographic predictors, census data, and exemption history in public schools to assess patterns of medical and elective vaccine exemption in New York State. Understanding the causes and correlates with low vaccination rates can inform spatial risks of disease outbreaks, and was a topic of interest during the covid-19 pandemic.</description>

      <description>Volcanoes Shiny App This is a Shiny App I made for an interactive Shiny App training I co-taught for the Computational Biodiversity Science and Services (BIOS2) Program. This app was one tool in the 6-hour training. It is accompanied by available and annotated code, explaining where and how workshop participants can add an element to improve the app.
Explore the App Here, or view materials from the entire Shiny training Here.</description>

      <description>Canadian Decapod Distribution Shiny App This interactive species distribution map was my contribution to the Canadian Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO) project, Estimating the interacting effects of groundfish predation and climate change on shellfish spatial distributions, funded by the Aquatic Climate Change Adaptation Services Program (ACCASP). The project involves projecting distributions of two Canadian shellfish fisheries based on scenarios of climate and predator density.
I used the leaflet, raster, and sf packages to create distribution maps, and the shinydashboard and shinyWidgets packages to develop the user interface.</description>
