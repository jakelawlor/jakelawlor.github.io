      <description>Targeting Protected Areas to Meet Conservation Goals Here, I worked with a team from the Canadian Department of Fisheries and Oceans Marine Planning and Conservation Team to develop an interactive tool showing how implementation of proposed protected areas on Canada&amp;rsquo;s East Coast would contribute to over 150 quantitative conservation targets for the region.
I used the protected area network design and conservation priotity spatial layers developed by DFO (see documentation here and here), along with the shiny, leaflet, and reactable R packages, and various javascript tricks to develop the application.</description>

      <description>Volcanoes Shiny App This is a Shiny App I made for an interactive Shiny App training I co-taught for the Computational Biodiversity Science and Services (BIOS2) Program. This app was one tool in the 6-hour training. It is accompanied by available and annotated code, explaining where and how workshop participants can add an element to improve the app.
Explore the App Here, or view materials from the entire Shiny training Here.</description>

      <description>Canadian Decapod Distribution Shiny App This interactive species distribution map was my contribution to the Canadian Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO) project, Estimating the interacting effects of groundfish predation and climate change on shellfish spatial distributions, funded by the Aquatic Climate Change Adaptation Services Program (ACCASP). The project involves projecting distributions of two Canadian shellfish fisheries based on scenarios of climate and predator density.
I used the leaflet, raster, and sf packages to create distribution maps, and the shinydashboard and shinyWidgets packages to develop the user interface.</description>
