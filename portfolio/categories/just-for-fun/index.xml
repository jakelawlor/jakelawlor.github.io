      <description>Generative Art January These visualizations represent my second attempt at generative art, inspired by the #Genuary2021 community on twitter. The prompt on this day was: Do anything with these 5 colors. Here, I made two different styles of visualized random data, with some parameters.
First, a modern-art-inspired piece using some geom_ribbons with random slopes behind two groups of randomly generated data points fitted with geom_bspline_closed functions creating curved objects. All colors are randomly chosen out of 5.</description>

      <description>Generative Art January - Increasing Randomness This plot was my first ever attempt at generative art, inspired by the #Genuary2021 community on twitter. The prompt on this day was: Increase the randomness along the Y-axis.
Basically, this code uses point coordinates spread evenly on a canvas, then expanded into 4 corners that will be the anchor points for geom_bspline_closed functions, which create the &amp;ldquo;circles&amp;rdquo; around each group of points. All groups of anchor points have some degree of randomness incorporated, but this randomness grows as a function of increased position on the Y axis.</description>

      <description>Mapping Bellingham This is a just-for-fun project I completed out of nostalgia for my years in Bellingham and to make some DIY wall art for my new home in Montreal. I used publicly-available spatial data from the City of Bellingham and roughly followed this tutorial to design the layout.</description>
