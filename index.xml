      <description>Canadian Decapod Distribution Shiny App This interactive species distribution map was my contribution to the Canadian Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO) project, Estimating the interacting effects of groundfish predation and climate change on shellfish spatial distributions, funded by the Aquatic Climate Change Adaptation Services Program (ACCASP). The project involves projecting distributions of two Canadian shellfish fisheries based on scenarios of climate and predator density.
I used the leaflet, raster, and sf packages to create distribution maps, and the shinydashboard and shinyWidgets packages to develop the user interface.</description>

      <description>One Decade of American Workers Wages This plot is one of my contributions to the #TidyTuesday R social project.
Here, I show the changes in wages for American workers by racial and ethnic group, as well as the wage gap between male and female workers. In these plots, I wanted to see if I could replicate the style of one of my biggest data visualization inspirations, The Economist. I used ggplot2 for plots, and cowplot to combine plots with background annotations.</description>

      <description>Generative Art January These visualizations represent my second attempt at generative art, inspired by the #Genuary2021 community on twitter. The prompt on this day was: Do anything with these 5 colors. Here, I made two different styles of visualized random data, with some parameters.
First, a modern-art-inspired piece using some geom_ribbons with random slopes behind two groups of randomly generated data points fitted with geom_bspline_closed functions creating curved objects. All colors are randomly chosen out of 5.</description>

      <description>Generative Art January - Increasing Randomness This plot was my first ever attempt at generative art, inspired by the #Genuary2021 community on twitter. The prompt on this day was: Increase the randomness along the Y-axis.
Basically, this code uses point coordinates spread evenly on a canvas, then expanded into 4 corners that will be the anchor points for geom_bspline_closed functions, which create the &amp;ldquo;circles&amp;rdquo; around each group of points. All groups of anchor points have some degree of randomness incorporated, but this randomness grows as a function of increased position on the Y axis.</description>

      <description>Ratings of Washington Hikes This plot is one of my contributions to the #TidyTuesday R social project. This plot shows the average rating scores of hikes in Washington State from reviews including the 10 most commonly used descriptors of trail views.
First, I used the tidytext package to extract every instance in a Washington Trails online review in which the word &amp;ldquo;view&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;views&amp;rdquo; were mentioned, then categorized the most common adjective describing these views.</description>

      <description>PNWColors My interest in natural science is connected to my long appreciation for beauty in nature, but I find that this appreciation is often forgotten for us ecologists who conduct our research from mostly inside of doors. To remind myself of this connection and to honor my years in the most beautiful place in the world, I developed this R color palette package based off of the natural beauty of the Pacific Northwest.</description>

      <description>Policy-Driven Market Fluctuations This is a series of plots I made for a California carbon tax consultancy showing market prices of fossil fuel emissions from specific policy initiatives around the world. The specific events and acronyms denoted in these graphs are somewhat esoteric and were largely chosen by the client, but I focused on using clear annotations, color, and spacing to effectively communicate the client&amp;rsquo;s ideas. All plots were completed using ggplot2 and ggforce.</description>
